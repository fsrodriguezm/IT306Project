If ideas for a proposal hasn't already been discussed here's an idea I had for one after thinking about it for a little while. I'm not sure if there are things she wants us to include or not, or make sure that can be used in the creation of it, but here goes

(Tyler) Idea 1: A youth basketball league creator

I think this would have a lot of flexibility in terms of how hard/detailed we want it for the other group making it. So as a base the application would read in a file of players with their names, position, and skill rating (1 through 5). The application would then sort the players by position then sort the positions by skill level. Next it would divide the players up evenly by skill and with a certain number of positions into teams. 

Additional things that could be added to make it more difficult or simply add to it:
- add coaches names, team names, team color, etc.
- assign each team a pratice schedule. One night a week at a certain local elementary/high school
- could generate a schedule of games so all teams play each other once
- add a way to enter scores of games all the way through the season and display a detailed score board

I came up with this idea rather quickly but I thought I'd throw it out there. Let me know what you guys think

(Felipe) Idea 2: Animal Shelter application

I'm basing this idea of this website: https://www.petfinder.com/
This application will read a list of animals from a file and categorize them by dog, cat or other animal. Each animal would have gender, location, type, breed and age. Then the user would have the option to sort out the data according to the one of those properties. If the user is happy with the result then he or she can save the list to a file. (Might need better ideas for that, I don't want to complicate the project for the other team.)

- A transaction can be made when adopting, we can include fees, vaccine fees, nuttering etc.
- Can keep track of how many animals are available for adoption
- Can kepp track of health of animals by rating (1-5)
- Can keep track of donations to shelter from user and offer discount 

(Lane) Idea 3:

I'm not sure if this idea works, but we could do a hospital or some sort of healthcare related system. We could have a list of patients/ doctors and sort the patients by doctor. Each doctor specializes in a certain ailment so the patients are sorted by ailment. I'm not sure what else would need to be added to this, but I'll try and think of more things.
